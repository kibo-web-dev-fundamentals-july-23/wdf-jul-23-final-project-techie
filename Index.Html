            <h2>CSS Styling</h2>

                <div class="text">

                    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page. With CSS, you can create visually appealing and consistent designs that enhance the user experience.

                        One of the key features of CSS is its ability to separate the presentation of a web page from its content. This means that you can define the style of your web page in a separate CSS file and apply it to multiple pages, making it easier to maintain and update your websiteâ€™s design.

                        CSS also provides powerful tools for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. With CSS, you can create flexible layouts that automatically adjust to the size of the userâ€™s screen, ensuring that your website looks great on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

                        Overall, CSS is an essential skill for web developers and plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p>

                        To create a responsive design, you can use CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the screen size of the device. For example, you can use media queries to change the layout of a page, resize images, and hide or show certain elements depending on the screen size.

                        In addition to media queries, there are other techniques and tools that can help you create responsive designs. For example, you can use flexible grids and flexible images to create fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. You can also use frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to quickly create responsive designs using pre-built components.

                        Overall, responsive design is an essential skill for web developers and plays a crucial role in creating user-friendly websites that provide a great user experience on all devices. </p>

                    <p>Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible on the internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a company that provides the technologies and services needed for the website to be viewed on the internet. Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers.

                        When someone wants to view your website, they simply type your website address or domain into their browser. Their computer will then connect to your server and your webpages will be delivered to them through the browser.

                        There are various types of web hosting services available to host your website. Some common types include shared hosting, dedicated hosting, and virtual private server (VPS) hosting. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the type of hosting you choose will depend on your specific needs.

                        Overall, web hosting is an essential part of building and maintaining a website, and choosing the right web host can help ensure that your site is fast, reliable, and accessible to your audience.  </p>

            <h2>Version Control (Git)</h2>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is a widely used version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if necessary.

                        Git is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning-fast performance. Git is commonly used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

                        One of the key features of Git is its branching model, which allows developers to create multiple branches of their code and work on them independently. This makes it easy to experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once a branch is ready, it can be merged back into the main branch.

                        Overall, Git is an essential tool for developers and plays a crucial role in managing and collaborating on code.  </p>

                    <p>Web development tools are software programs that developers use to create, test, and debug web applications. These tools can help developers work more efficiently and effectively, and can include text editors, integrated development environments (IDEs), debugging tools, and more.

                        Some popular web development tools include Visual Studio Code, a powerful text editor with built-in support for many programming languages; Chrome DevTools, a set of web developer tools built into the Google Chrome browser; and Git, a version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code and collaborate with others.

                        In addition to these tools, there are many other resources available to help developers improve their skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. These can include online tutorials, forums, and communities where developers can share knowledge and learn from each other.

                        Overall, web development tools play a crucial role in helping developers create high-quality web applications.
